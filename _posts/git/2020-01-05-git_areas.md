## Work between different git areas

### Purpose

Git is powerful as it has different areas, and users could work in each of them depending on what you do.



### You will learn

1. different areas
2. how to travel b/w these areas
3. some common scenarios in your daily work life



### Lets Go

#### areas

![image-gitareas](/img/git/git_area.png)

##### 1. working area: namely, is the area where you work on, recording all your changes

we can see this in git command, which marked as 'untracked '

```
echo 'work between different git areas' -> gitareas.txt         # firstly, we create a file as our daily work would do.
➜  gitUsageDemo git:(feature/one) ✗ git status     # with this command to show the git status
On branch feature/one
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/feature/one'.
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	gitareas.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

##### 2. staging area: an intermediate area where commits can be formatted and reviewed before completing the commit, and of course, is 'tracked' compared with working area.

```
➜  gitUsageDemo git:(feature/one) ✗ git add gitareas.txt
➜  gitUsageDemo git:(feature/one) ✗ git status
On branch feature/one
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/feature/one'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   gitareas.txt
```

##### 3. repository: namely, is the repo of your working files, would generate a commit id representing your one-time commitment.

```
➜  gitUsageDemo git:(feature/one) ✗ git commit -a     # add to repository
[feature/one 513fcfe] add gitarea.txt
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 gitareas.txt
 gitUsageDemo git:(feature/one) git log    # show commit logs
 commit 513fcfe653a10e4fe3bf3ae46289dd224ae8aead
Author: Jack Pan <jack.pan01@sap.com>
Date:   Sun Jan 5 12:20:46 2020 +0800

    add gitarea.txt
```

Obviously, unique commit id is generated after you commit.



#### travel b/w these areas

- From `working area` To `staging area`      --- using `git add`

```
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	gitareas.txt
```

- From `staging area` To `working area`     --- using `git reset `

```
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/feature/one'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   gitareas.txt
```



- From `staging area` To ` local repository `  --- using `git commit`

- From `local repository` To `staging area`  --- using `git reset`

```
gitUsageDemo git:(feature/one) git reset head~
our branch is up-to-date with 'origin/feature/one'.
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	gitareas.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

then: using get add to add files from `working area` to `staging area`

- From `local repo` To `remote repo` --- using  `git push`

```
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/feature/one' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

- From `remote repo` To `local * ` --- using `git revert` and ` git push`

for now, we have 3 commit logs, and we wanna revert the latest one as we do not need any more.

```
9dc8a7d add gitarea.txt
60b8d63 add desc file
ae0a6fa first commit
```

after we typed 'git revert [commit-id]'

```
➜  gitUsageDemo git:(feature/one) git revert head~          # head~ means the latest commit
[feature/one b0bef34] Revert "add desc file"
 1 file changed, 1 deletion(-)
 delete mode 100644 desc.txt
```

```
# show current local logs
b0bef34 Revert "add desc file"
9dc8a7d add gitarea.txt
60b8d63 add desc file
ae0a6fa first commit
```

then using `git push` to sync local and remote repos
